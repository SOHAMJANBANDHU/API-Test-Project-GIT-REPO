# API Test Project

This project contains API test cases for testing the functionality and performance of an API on Git Hub.

## Test Cases

The `tests/` directory contains the following test case files:

- `GITHUB.postman_test_run.json`: This file includes test cases related to feature CREATE an Repository.
- `GITHUB.postman_test_run.json`: This file includes test cases related to feature GET an Repository.
- `GITHUB.postman_test_run.json`: This file includes test cases related to feature UPDATE an Repository.
- `GITHUB.postman_test_run.json`: This file includes test cases related to feature DELETE an Repository.

Feel free to explore each file to understand the specific test cases and their implementation details.

## Configuration

The `config/` directory includes the following configuration file:

- `GITHUB.postman_test_run.json`: This file contains the configuration settings for the API tests. Update the necessary values such as base URL, authentication details, or other relevant settings before running the tests.

## Test Data

The `data/` directory includes the following test data files:

- `data.txt`: This file provides sample JSON payloads or data sets used in the API test cases.

Feel free to modify or add more test data files as needed for your specific test scenarios.

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the required packages and their versions.

## Running the Tests

To run the API tests, 

vbnet
Copy code

Make sure you have the appropriate Python environment set up and activated before running the tests.

It is generally not recommended to share sensitive information, such as environment IDs, collection IDs, or any other credentials, in public repositories on GitHub or any other public code-sharing platform.

When sharing your project on GitHub, it's important to ensure that any sensitive information is not exposed publicly. You can follow these best practices:

Remove sensitive information: Before uploading your project, make sure to remove any sensitive data or credentials from your code, configuration files, or test data files. Replace them with placeholders or generic values.

Use environment variables: Instead of hardcoding sensitive information directly in your code or configuration files, consider using environment variables to store such values. This allows you to keep sensitive information separate from your codebase and provides more flexibility when running your tests in different environments.

Use configuration files: Store any sensitive information or credentials in a separate configuration file that is excluded from version control. You can provide a template or sample configuration file with placeholder values and instructions on how to populate it with the necessary information.

Add configuration files to .gitignore: Make sure to include your configuration files (containing sensitive information) in the .gitignore file so that they are not accidentally committed and pushed to the repository. This ensures that the sensitive information remains local to your development environment.

By following these practices, you can protect your sensitive information and ensure that it's not exposed when sharing your project on GitHub.
